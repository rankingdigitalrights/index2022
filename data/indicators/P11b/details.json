Such requests are often informal requests for user information from a non-governmental entity that do not involve or come through any formal legal process. According to the Wikimedia Foundation—which publishes <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/transparency/2019-2/requests-for-user-information/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591114490472000'>transparency reports</a> with data on the number of these types of requests it receives—private requests for user information includes cases in which another company sends them a letter or an email requesting “non-public information” about one of its users. This could include a user's IP and email address.</p> <p>Just as companies should publish data about the government demands they receive to hand over user information, companies should also publish data about requests for user information they receive (and comply with) that come through any private processes. We expect companies to regularly publish data about the number and type of such requests they receive, and the number of such requests with which they comply. Companies should also report this data once a year and ensure the data can be exported in a structured data file.</p>","isParent":false,"hasParent":true}
