We expect companies to clearly disclose what user information they collect and how they do so. We also expect companies to commit to the principle of data minimization and to demonstrate how this principle shapes their practices regarding user information. If companies collect multiple types of information, we expect them to provide details on how they handle each type of information. For mobile ecosystems and personal digital assistant (PDA) ecosystems, we expect the company to clearly disclose whether the privacy policies of the apps or PDA skills that are available in its mobile app store or PDA skill store specify what user information the apps or skills collect and whether those policies comply with data minimization principles.","isParent":false,"hasParent":true}
