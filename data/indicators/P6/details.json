{"id":"P06","name":"P6","category":"privacy","label":"Retention of user information","description":"The company should clearly disclose how long it retains user information.","guidance":"Just as we expect companies to disclose what information they collect and share about us, we also expect companies to clearly disclose for how long they retain it and the extent to which they remove identifiers from user information they store. In addition, users should also be able to understand what happens to their information when they delete their accounts. In some cases, laws or regulations may require companies to retain certain information for a given period of time. In these cases, companies should clearly disclose these regulations to users. Companies that choose to retain user information for extended periods of time should also take steps to ensure that data is not tied to a specific user. Acknowledging the ongoing debates about the efficacy of de-identification processes, and the growing sophistication around re-identification practices, we still consider de-identification a positive step that companies can take to protect the privacy of their users. In addition, if companies collect multiple types of information, we expect them to clearly disclose for how long they retain each type of information. For mobile ecosystems and personal digital assistant (PDA) ecosystems, we expect companies to disclose whether the privacy policies of the mobile apps and PDA skills that are available in their app and skill store state how long the app or skill retains user information and whether all user information is deleted if users terminate or delete the app or the skill.","isParent":false,"hasParent":false}
