{"id":"P03b","name":"P3b","category":"privacy","label":"Inference of user information","description":"The company should clearly disclose what user information it infers and how.","guidance":"In addition to collecting information about users, companies also perform big data analytics to make inferences, or predictions, about users on the basis of the collected information. These methods might be used to make inferences about user preferences or attributes (such as race, gender, sexual orientation), and opinions (including political opinions), or to predict consumer behaviors. Without sufficient transparency and user control over data inference, privacy-invasive and non-verifiable inferences cannot be predicted, understood, or refuted by users. In addition to disclosing the information that they collect, companies should disclose what information they infer and how they infer it. They should also commit to only infer information that is relevant and necessary to provide the service. For example, companies should not try to infer their users' religion, sexual orientation, or health status (such as by assigning them to an audience category based on this characteristic) unless that information is somehow directly necessary to accomplish the purpose of their service.","isParent":false,"hasParent":true}
