{"id":"P08","name":"P8","category":"privacy","label":"Users' access to their own user information","description":"Companies should allow users to obtain all of their user information the company holds.","guidance":"Users should be able to obtain all public-facing and internal information that companies hold about them, including the information that a company has used to make inferences, or predictions, about them. We expect companies to clearly disclose what options users have to obtain this information, what data this record contains, and what formats users can obtain it in. Companies should also enable users to access the list of advertising categories that they have been assigned to. In order to target ads, companies typically assign each user to any number of audience categories. Advertisers can then select which audience categories they want to target. Users should be able to know which audience categories the company has assigned them to, on the basis of information that the company has collected or inferred about users. For mobile ecosystems, we expect the company to disclose to users whether the apps that are available in its app store specify that users can obtain all of the user information that app holds about them. We expect companies that operate personal digital assistant (PDA) skill stores to set minimum standards that the third-party skills hosted on their platform must meet. Just as we expect companies themselves to disclose that users can obtain a record of their own user information from the company, PDA skill stores should require skills in their store to provide similar disclosure.","isParent":false,"hasParent":false}
