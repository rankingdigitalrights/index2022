{"id":"G04b","name":"G4b","category":"governance","label":"Impact assessment: Processes for policy enforcement","description":"The company should conduct regular, comprehensive, and credible due diligence, such as through robust human rights impact assessments, to identify how its processes for policy enforcement affect users' fundamental rights to freedom of expression and information, to privacy, and to non-discrimination, and to mitigate any risks posed by those impacts.","guidance":"This indicator examines whether companies disclose if they conduct robust, regular, and accountable human rights risk assessments of the impact of their own policies on users' fundamental rights to freedom of expression, privacy, and non-discrimination. These assessments should be part of the company's formal, systematic due diligence activities that are aimed at ensuring that a company's decisions and practices do not cause, contribute to, or exacerbate human rights harms. Assessments enable companies to identify possible risks of their own policies to users' rights to expression and information, privacy, and to non-discrimination, and to take steps to mitigate possible harms if they are identified. Note that this indicator does not expect companies to publish detailed results of their human rights impact assessments, since assessments may include sensitive information. Rather, it expects that companies should disclose that they conduct HRIAs and provide information on what their HRIA process encompasses.","isParent":false,"hasParent":true}
