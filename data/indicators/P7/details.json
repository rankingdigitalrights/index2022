Enabling users to control what information about them that a company collects, infers, and retains would mean giving users the ability to delete specific types of user information without requiring them to delete their entire account. We therefore expect companies to clearly disclose whether users have the option to delete specific types of user information. In addition, we expect companies to enable users to control the use of their information for the purpose of targeted advertising and algorithmic system development. Targeted advertising requires extensive collection, retention, and inference of user information, and companies should therefore clearly disclose whether users have options to control how their information is being used for these purposes.</p> <p>For mobile ecosystems and personal digital assistant (PDA) ecosystems, we expect companies to clearly disclose what options users have to control the collection of their location information. A user's location changes frequently and many users carry their mobile devices nearly everywhere, making the collection of this type of information particularly sensitive. In addition, the location settings on mobile ecosystems and personal digital assistant ecosystems can influence how other products and services access their location information. For instance, mobile apps or PDA ecosystem skills may enable users to control location information. However, if the device on which those mobile apps or PDA skills run collects geolocation data by default and does not give users a way to turn this off, users may not be able to limit mobile apps' or PDA skills' collection of their location information. For these reasons, we expect companies to disclose that users can control how their device interacts with their location information.</p>","isParent":false,"hasParent":false}
