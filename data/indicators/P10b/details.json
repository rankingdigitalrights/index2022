According to the Wikimedia Foundation—which publishes <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/transparency/2019-2/requests-for-user-information/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591114490459000'>transparency reports</a> with e data on the number of these types of such requests it receives—private requests for user information include cases in which another company sends them a letter or an email requesting “non-public information” about one of its users. This could include a user's IP or email address. This indicator expects companies to disclose their processes for handling these types of requests. Companies should explain reasons for complying with these types of requests, and commit to push back on overly broad demands.</p>","isParent":false,"hasParent":true}
