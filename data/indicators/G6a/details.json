{"id":"G06a","name":"G6a","category":"governance","label":"Remedy","description":"The company should have clear and predictable grievance and remedy mechanisms to address users' freedom of expression and privacy concerns.","guidance":"Human rights can only be protected and respected if people have redress when they believe their rights have been violated. This indicator examines whether companies provide such remedy mechanisms and whether they have publicly disclosed processes for responding to grievances from individuals who believe that the company has violated or directly facilitated violations of their freedom of expression or privacy. We expect companies to clearly disclose a grievance mechanism enabling users to submit complaints if they feel their freedom of expression and privacy have been infringed by the company's policies or practices. To receive full credit on Element 1, a company's grievance mechanism does not have to explicitly state that it applies to freedom of expression and privacy related complaints. However it should be clear that this mechanism can be used to file any type of human rights-related grievance. We also expect a company's grievance mechanism to be clearly accessible to users. In addition, the company should explain its process for providing remedy to these types of complaints, and disclose evidence of doing so. Companies should describe clear timelines for addressing each stage of the grievance and remedy processes. These standards are outlined in Principle 31 of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which states that businesses should publish clear, accessible, and predictable remedy procedures.","isParent":false,"hasParent":true}
