In addition, systems that are optimized for user engagement can have the effect of prioritizing controversial and inflammatory content, including content that is not protected under international human rights law. Over time, reliance on algorithmic curation and recommendation systems that are optimized for engagement can alter the news and information ecosystems of entire countries or communities. These systems can be manipulated to spread disinformation and otherwise distort the information ecosystem, which can in turn fuel human rights abuses.</p> <p>Companies should therefore be transparent about their use of automated curation, recommendation, and ranking systems, including the variables that influence such systems. Companies should publish information about whether they use algorithmic systems to curate, recommend, and rank content. They should disclose how these systems work, what options users have to control how their information is used by these systems, whether such systems are automatically on by default, or whether users can “opt-in” to have their content automatically curated by the algorithmic system.</p>","isParent":false,"hasParent":false}
