However, these changes, which may include revising rules about prohibited content and activities, can affect users' freedom of expression and information as well as their right to non-discrimination.</p> <p>Companies therefore should commit to notifying users when they change these terms and to providing users with information that helps them understand what these changes mean.</p> <p>This indicator evaluates whether companies clearly disclose the method and timeframe for notifying users about changes prior to changes coming into effect. The method of direct notification may differ according to the type of service; we expect companies to directly notify users in a way that users are sure to access. For services that contain user accounts, direct notification may involve sending an email or an SMS. For services that do not require a user account, direct notification may involve posting a prominent notice where users access that service. This indicator also seeks evidence that a company provides publicly available records of previous terms so that people can understand how the company's terms have evolved over time.</p>","isParent":false,"hasParent":true}
