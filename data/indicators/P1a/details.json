{"id":"P01a","name":"P1a","category":"privacy","label":"Access to privacy policies","description":"The company should offer privacy policies that are easy to find and easy to understand.","guidance":"Privacy policies address how companies collect, manage, use, and secure information about users as well as information provided by users. Given this, companies should ensure that users can easily locate this policy and to make an effort to help users understand what they mean. This indicator expects companies to publish privacy policies that are easy to find, are available in the primary languages spoken in the company's home market, and easy to understand. If the company offers multiple products and services, it should be clear to what products and services the privacy policies applies. A document that is “easy to find” should be easily accessible from the company's homepage or service website. It should be located a few clicks away from the homepage, or otherwise accessible in a logical place where users are likely to find it. The terms should also be available in the major language(s) of the home market. In addition, we expect a company to take steps to help users understand the information presented in their policies. This may include, but is not limited to, providing summaries, tips, or guidance that explain what the terms mean, using section headers, readable font size, or other graphical features to help users understand the document, or writing the terms using readable syntax.","isParent":false,"hasParent":true}
