Companies should clearly disclose that senior leadership—from the board to management level—oversees and is accountable for its policies and practices affecting these human rights.</p> <p>To receive full credit for this indicator, companies need to clearly disclose that at each governance level (board, executive, managerial), there is clear oversight of both freedom of expression and information, and privacy issues.</p> <p>At the board level, this oversight could include a board of directors or another public explanation of how the board exercises oversight over these issues. Below board level, it can include a company unit, program, or individual that reports to the executive or managerial level. The committee, program, team, officer, etc. should specifically identify freedom of expression and privacy in its description of responsibilities.</p>","isParent":false,"hasParent":false}
