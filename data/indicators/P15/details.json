Given that data breaches can result in significant threats to an individual's financial or personal security, in addition to exposing private information, companies should make these processes publicly available. Individuals can then make informed decisions and consider the potential risks before signing up for a service or giving a company their information. We expect companies to have formal policies in place regarding their handling of data breaches if and when they occur, and to make this information about these policies and commitments public prior to a breach occurring.","isParent":false,"hasParent":false}
