{"id":"G04a","name":"G4a","category":"governance","label":"Impact assessment: Governments and regulations","description":"Companies should conduct regular, comprehensive, and credible due diligence, through robust human rights impact assessments, to identify how government regulations and policies affect freedom of expression and information and privacy, and to mitigate any risks posed by those impacts in the jurisdictions in which it operates.","guidance":"This indicator examines whether companies conduct regular, robust, and accountable human rights risk assessments of government regulations and policies in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These assessments should be part of the company's formal, systematic due diligence activities that are aimed at ensuring that their decisions and practices do not cause, contribute to, or exacerbate human rights harms. Assessments enable companies to identify possible risks to users' freedom of expression and privacy rights and to take steps to mitigate possible harms if they are identified. Note that this indicator does not expect companies to publish detailed results of their human rights impact assessments, since assessments may include sensitive information. Rather, it expects that companies should disclose that they conduct HRIAs and provide information on what their HRIA process encompasses.","isParent":false,"hasParent":true}
