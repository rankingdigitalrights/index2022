Targeting, which can include both paid and unpaid content, can amplify offline social inequities and can be overtly discriminatory. It can also result in so-called “filter bubbles,” as well as spread problematic content, including content intended to mislead or to spread falsehoods.</p> <p>Therefore, companies that enable advertisers and other third parties to target their users with tailored ads or content should have clear policies describing their ad targeting rules. Companies should clearly disclose whether they enable third parties to target their users with tailored ads or other types of sponsored content , and clearly disclose what targeting parameters—like using certain types of audience categories, like age, location, or other user characteristics—are not permitted. Companies should also disclose their processes for identifying breaches to targeting rules.</p>","isParent":false,"hasParent":true}
