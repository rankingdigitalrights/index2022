The U.N. Human Rights Council has condemned network shutdowns as a violation of international human rights law and called on governments to refrain from taking these actions. Yet governments are increasingly ordering telecommunications companies to shut down their networks, which in turn puts pressure on companies to take actions that violate their responsibility to respect human rights. We expect companies to fully disclose the circumstances under which they might take such action, to report on the demands they receive to take such actions, and to disclose commitments to push back on or mitigate the effects of government orders.</p>","isParent":false,"hasParent":false}
