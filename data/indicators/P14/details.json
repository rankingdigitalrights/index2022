When companies learn of vulnerabilities that could put users and their information at risk, they should take action to mitigate those concerns. This includes ensuring that people are able to share any vulnerabilities they discover with the company. We believe it is especially important for companies to provide clear policies to users about the manner and time period in which users will receive security updates. In addition, since telecommunications providers can alter open-source mobile operating systems, we expect these companies to disclose information that may affect a user's ability to access these critical updates.","isParent":false,"hasParent":false}
