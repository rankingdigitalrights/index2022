We expect companies to help users protect themselves against such risks. This can include publishing materials on how to set up advanced account authentication or adjust privacy settings, how to avoid malware, phishing, and social engineering attacks, how to avoid or address bullying or harassment online, and what “safe browsing” means. Companies should present this guidance using clear language, ideally paired with visual materials, designed to help users understand the nature of the risks companies and users can face. These materials can take many forms including tips, tutorials, how-to guides, FAQs, or other resources presented in a way that users can easily understand.</p>","isParent":false,"hasParent":false}
