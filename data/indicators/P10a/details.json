{"id":"P10a","name":"P10a","category":"privacy","label":"Process for responding to government demands for user information","description":"The company should clearly disclose its process for responding to governments demands for user information.","guidance":"Companies increasingly receive government demands to turn over user information. These demands can come from government agencies or courts (both domestic and foreign). We expect companies to publicly disclose their process for responding to demands from governments, along with the basis for complying with these requests. Companies should also publicly commit to pushing back on inappropriate or overbroad government demands. In some cases, the law might prevent a company from disclosing information referenced in this indicator's elements. Researchers will document situations where this is the case, but a company will still lose points if it fails to meet standards for all elements. This represents a situation where the law causes companies to fall short of best practice, and we encourage companies to advocate for laws that enable them to fully respect users' rights to freedom of expression and privacy.","isParent":false,"hasParent":true}
