These requests can come from government agencies, law enforcement, and courts (both domestic and foreign). We expect companies to publicly disclose their processes for responding to these types of demands. Companies should disclose the legal reasons why it would comply with a government demand, as well as disclose a clear commitment to push back on overly broad demands. Note that our definition of “government demands” includes those that come through a “non-judicial” process, such as orders from law enforcement, as well as civil cases made by private parties that come through civil courts. Takedown requests that are made via organized processes like the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act or the European Right to be Forgotten ruling are defined as “private processes” and are evaluated in Indicator F5b below.","isParent":false,"hasParent":true}
