{"id":"G03","name":"G3","category":"governance","label":"Internal implementation","description":"The company should have mechanisms in place to implement its commitments to freedom of expression and information and privacy within the company.","guidance":"Indicator G3 evaluates whether a company's senior leadership commits to overseeing freedom of expression and privacy issues. This indicator, G3, evaluates if the company discloses whether and how these commitments are institutionalized across the company. More specifically, this indicator seeks disclosure of whether and how the company helps employees understand the importance of freedom of expression and privacy. When employees write computer code for a new product, review requests for user data, or answer customer questions about how to use a service, they act in ways that can directly affect users' freedom of expression and privacy. We expect companies to disclose information about whether they provide training that informs employees of their role in respecting human rights and that provides employees with an outlet to voice concerns they have regarding human rights. A company can only receive full credit on this indicator if it clearly discloses information about employee training on freedom of expression and information, and privacy, as well as the existence of whistleblower programs addressing these issues. Disclosure should specify that employee training and whistleblower programs cover freedom of expression and privacy. Companies may still receive credit on this indicator if a company's whistleblower program does not specifically mention complaints related to freedom of expression and privacy so long as the company has made commitments to these principles elsewhere and in a way that makes clear that the company would entertain those complaints through their whistleblower program.","isParent":false,"hasParent":false}
