{"id":"F01b","name":"F1b","category":"freedom","label":"Access to advertising content policies","description":"The company should offer advertising content policies that are easy to find and easy to understand.","guidance":"Companies that enable any type of advertising on their services or platforms should clearly disclose the rules for what types of ad content is prohibited—for example, ads that discriminate against individuals or groups based on personal attributes like age, religion, gender, and ethnicity. Companies should be transparent about these rules so that both users and advertisers can understand what types of ad content are not permissible and so they can be accountable for the ad content that appears on their services or platforms. Therefore, companies should make these rules easy to find (E1), easy to understand (E3), and available in the main languages of the company's home market (E2). Companies that operate mobile ecosystems (Apple iOS, Google Android, and Samsung's implementation of Android) and personal digital assistant ecosystems (Amazon's Alexa, Alibaba's AliGenie) should enable users to choose which apps or skills to download on the basis of their participation (or not) in advertising networks. Therefore, Element 4 and Element 5 ask whether the company discloses a requirement for apps or skills made available through its app store or skills store to provide users with an advertising content policy.","isParent":false,"hasParent":true}
