The Chinese government requires internet content platforms to monitor, filter, and control content that is illegal under Chinese law. Although Baidu provided some data about illegal content and ads the company restricted, it failed to publish clear content moderation, ad content, and targeting rules or to clarify its process to enforce those rules.</p><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Content moderation: </span>Baidu disclosed its reasons for restricting content or accounts when they stood in violation of its terms of service, but its explanation of the policy enforcement process was vague (F3a). Baidu did not commit to notify users about changes to its terms of service (F2a) or when their content or accounts were restricted (F8). The company provided some data about the content or accounts it restricted for violating its rules (F4a, F4b).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Algorithmic use and content curation: </span>Baidu failed to release any operational policies governing the use or development of its algorithmic systems (F1d, P1b). The company implied that it deploys algorithmic systems to curate, recommend, and rank content, but did not explain clearly how those algorithms work (F12). Baidu also failed to explain how it regulates the use of bots on its platform (F13). </li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Advertising content and targeting: </span>Baidu&rsquo;s ad content rules were not all easy to find (F1b). They listed types of content that the company prohibits and described some of its processes for identifying violations (F3b). Baidu was the only digital platform outside the U.S. that reported data about the ads it removed for violating ad content rules (F4c). Baidu provided some parameters for targeted advertising, but it failed to disclose its ad targeting rules (F1c), describe how it enforces them (F3c), or release any data about these practices (F4c). </li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Censorship demands: </span>For the first time, Baidu provided some information about its process for handling government and private requests to restrict contents or accounts by clarifying the legal basis&mdash;China&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cybersecurity Law&rdquo;<sup><a href=\"#ftnt3\" id=\"ftnt_ref3\">[3]</a></sup>&mdash;under which it may respond to government demands for content and account restrictions. It also implied that it conducts limited due diligence on copyright-related content restriction requests coming through private processes (F5b).  The company disclosed no further information about these processes, and Baidu did not publish any data about third-party requests for account or content censorship (F6, F7). Although no specific laws or regulations in China prohibit Chinese companies from publishing data about government demands to restrict content, the political environment discourages them from releasing such information. </li></ul>","privacy":"<p>Baidu received a lower-than-average score on privacy, but still outranked nearly half of the digital platforms that we evaluated.</p><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Handling of user data: </span>Baidu&rsquo;s privacy policies failed to adequately articulate how it handles user information. After Tencent, Baidu disclosed more than all other digital platforms about what types of user information it collects (P3a), but less about what information it shares (P4) and why (P5). Baidu offered limited details on its collection of user information from third parties (P9) and about its data inference practices (P3b).  The company failed to disclose how long it retains user information (P6) and gave users few options to control or access the information the company retains about them (P7, P8). </li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Government and private demands for user data: </span>Baidu was one of the three digital platforms, along with Samsung and Tencent, that revealed nothing about how it handles government and private requests to access user information (P10). It published no data about its compliance with these types of demands (P11). Baidu described some circumstances in which it would not need to notify users about government requests for user data (P12). Although there are no laws or regulations in China prohibiting Chinese companies from releasing data about government demands to access user information, the political environment discourages companies from doing so.</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Security: </span>Baidu made big improvements to its transparency around security policies, earning the third-best average score on our security indicators among digital platforms, after earning the second-lowest security scores in the 2019 RDR Index. In addition to limiting employees&rsquo; access to user data, Baidu disclosed it had a team dedicated to conducting internal security audits and also commissioned external third-party audits (P13). Along with Alibaba, Baidu outperformed all other digital platforms for strong disclosure of its policies for handling data breaches, as required under China&rsquo;s cybersecurity law<sup><a href=\"#ftnt4\" id=\"ftnt_ref4\">[4]</a></sup> (P15). Baidu also offered more information to help users keep their accounts secure (P17) and protect themselves from cybersecurity risks (P18). The company failed to disclose sufficient information about its bug bounty program (P14). </li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Encryption: </span>Apart from a vague commitment to adopt &ldquo;encryption technologies,&rdquo; Baidu did not offer users the ability to deploy end-to-end encryption for their private communications.
