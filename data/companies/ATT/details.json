The company also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-at-t-ceo-interview-exclusive/exclusive-att-considers-cellphone-plans-subsidized-by-ads-idUKKBN2663HH\">announced in mid-2020</a> that it was considering offering customers reduced plan rates if they agreed to receive targeted ads.

The company showed only scant evidence of conducting human rights due diligence, little evidence of stakeholder engagement, and weak remedy mechanisms. </p><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Commitment to human rights: </span>AT&amp;T published a human rights policy that explicitly commits to protect users&rsquo; fundamentalfreedom of expression and privacy rights. However, it did not explicitly commit to abide by human rights in its development and use of algorithmic systems (G1).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Human rights due diligence:</span> AT&amp;T disclosed scant detail about its human rights due diligence. It conducted risk assessments on some aspects of the regulatory environments of the markets in which it operates. AT&amp;T indicated that it carries out assessments of privacy risks associated with its use and development of artificial intelligence, but did not make a similar statement on freedom of expression or discrimination risks (G4d). The company did not provide evidence of conducting assessments of privacy, expression, or discrimation risks associated with its zero-rating programs or targeted advertising (G4e, G4c).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Stakeholder engagement: </span>While AT&amp;T is not a member of a multistakeholder organization that systematically addresses its impact on users&rsquo; freedom of expression and privacy, it does engage with various NGOs and stakeholders on digital rights issues (G5).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Remedy: </span>AT&amp;T failed to provide users with clear, predictable remedy mechanisms for freedom of expression- or privacy-related grievances (G6a).</li></ul>","freedom":"<p>AT&amp;T disclosed less about policies affecting freedom of expression than Telenor, Vodafone and Telef&oacute;nica.  </p><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Content blocking and account restrictions:</span> The rules governing the use of AT&amp;T&rsquo;s services were mostly clear, but some were hard to find (F1a). Policies clearly explained what types of content and activities were prohibited on its services (F3a) but the company reported no data about the volume of content and accounts restricted to enforce those rules (F4a, F4b).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Advertising content and targeting: </span>AT&amp;T disclosed some of its rules governing targeted advertising (F3b, F3c). But it did not report any data disclosing ad content removed for violations of these rules (F4c).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Censorship demands: </span>The company failed to disclose a policy that clearly states its processes for handling government and private demands for content blocking (F5). While AT&amp;T was among only three telecommunications companies in the RDR Index to report any data about compliance with government demands (F6), it could be more transparent with users in this area. It also disclosed nothing about private requests to block content or deactivate accounts, such as reports of child sexual abuse material from the Internet Watch Foundation (F7). </li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Network management:</span> The company&rsquo;s network management policies and practices were unclear and contradictory. While AT&amp;T made a commitment to net neutrality, it did not maintain this commitment in practice, due to its zero-rating programs (F9). It also disclosed almost nothing about its policies for handling government demands to shut down a network, although it did clarify that it would report the number of government requests to shut down its networks if it received such requests (F10).</li></ul>","privacy":"<p>AT&amp;T placed fourth in privacy, after Deutsche Telekom, Telefonica, and Vodafone. The company stood out for strong disclosure of its process for responding to government demands for user information but lacked transparency on its data collection and retention policies. </p><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Handling of user data: </span>AT&amp;T no longer provided a comprehensive list of the types data it collects (P3a) and while it acknowledged that it infers information about users, it failed to provide the types of information it infers (P3b) and did not provide users with options to control company attempts to infer their data (P7). AT&amp;T stated that it collects information about its customers from outside sources, such as credit reports or public posts to social networking sites (P9). However, it did not say how and for what purpose it collects these types of details from third parties and for how long it retains them (P9)<span className=\"font-bold\">.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Government and private demands for user data:</span> AT&amp;T clearly explained its process for responding to demands it received from governments (P10a), and it disclosed data on  those that it received and complied with (P11a). Like other U.S. companies, it did not divulge the exact number of requests received for user data under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or National Security Letters, since it is prohibited by <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1874\">law</a> from doing so. The company did not provide information about requests for user information that came through private processes.</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Security: </span>AT&amp;T disclosed evidence of having strong security auditing and oversight (P13) and improved its disclosures about its policies on data breaches (P15). But the company did not commit to allowing external researchers to submit reports of security vulnerabilities without fear of legal repercussions (P14), which put it behind Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom on security indicators.</li></ul>","footnotes":"<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref1\" id=\"ftnt1\">[1]</a> We do not evaluate policies that were published more than three years before the research period of each RDR Index.
