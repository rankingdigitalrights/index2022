In South Africa, the company faced a legal regime in flux, as regulators pushed to implement <a href=\"https://www.onetrust.com/blog/when-will-south-africas-popia-enter-fully-into-effect/\">POPIA</a>, the country&rsquo;s omnibus privacy law. In 2020, MTN published a raft of policies and statements outlining the company&rsquo;s approach to various human rights topics. It  also released the <a href=\"https://www.mtn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MTN-Transparency-Report-2020_Final.pdf\">first transparency report</a> in its 26-year history, but this was published after the research period for the 2020 RDR Index, and thus was not accounted for in the company&rsquo;s score this year.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt1\" id=\"ftnt_ref1\">[1]</a></sup></p>","changesTitle":"Changes since 2019","changes":"<ul><li>MTN released a cascade of new and updated position statements affirming its commitments to human rights and describing how they are implemented internally. </li></ul><ul><li>MTN published more information about its process for responding to external censorship demands and demands for user information.</li></ul><ul><li>MTN improved its security practices by announcing a new program to solicit vulnerability reports from external researchers.</li></ul><ul><li>MTN removed a commitment to notify postpaid mobile users when it changes its terms of service, thus making it harder for users to understand its rules.</li></ul>","keyRecommendationTitle":"Key recommendations","keyRecommendation":"<ul><li>Disclose more about human rights due diligence.

MTN should be explicit about what user information it collects and shares, for what purposes, and for how long it retains it.</li></ul><ul><li>Improve access to policy documents. MTN should make its terms of service and other policies more accessible.</li></ul><ul><li>Improve transparency on network shutdowns.

It explained how human rights oversight works at the board, executive, and management level (G2). MTN&rsquo;s Digital Human Rights position statement described employee training on both privacy and freedom of expression, and its new whistleblowing position statement also covered these rights (G3).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Human rights due diligence: </span>MTN clarified that its human rights impact assessments cover at least some new activities but still failed to specify whether they encompass the impacts of algorithmic systems and zero rating, among others (G4).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Stakeholder engagement: </span>MTN disclosed no evidence of conducting systematic engagement with stakeholders whose rights are directly impacted by the company (G5).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Remedy: </span>Despite disclosing a general grievance mechanism, MTN published no information about its procedures or time frames for providing remedy to address its privacy and freedom of expression grievances (G6a).</li></ul>","freedom":"<p>MTN was not transparent about policies and practices affecting freedom of expression, but still performed better in this category than any other telecommunications company based outside of the E.U. or the U.S.</p><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Content blocking and account restrictions: </span>MTN&rsquo;s rules were difficult to find (F1a). It was inconsistent in explaining how these policies are enforced, including how violations are detected and addressed (F3a). The company released no data about how it enforced account restrictions and blocking of content such as websites (F4).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Network management:</span> MTN made no commitment to network neutrality and continued to run a zero-rating program that gives users free access to Facebook (F9). In 2019 and 2020, MTN complied with numerous internet shutdowns orders from governments in several of its operating markets. It failed to document these orders publicly and systematically. However, the company did clarify a previously vague pledge to push back against government shutdown demands, continuing a trend of improvement since the 2019 RDR Index (F10).  </li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Censorship demands:</span> MTN released no data documenting government or private demands to restrict accounts or block content, such as websites (F6, F7).

It was the only telecommunications company, however, to disclose that it allows users to download some of the data it infers about them (P8).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Government and private demands for user information: </span>MTN revealed some details about its process for responding to demands for user information, but the list of steps in this process was incomplete and the company did not describe the legal basis for complying with such demands or illustrate how it implements them (P10). It also released no data about the quantity or type of demands it received, or how it responded (P11), but, as noted above, the company released its first transparency report in November 2020, which fell outside the time frame of the research period.</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Security:</span> Though its security policies are still some of the least transparent among telecommunications companies we evaluated, MTN made a breakthrough by launching a dedicated portal allowing external researchers to submit reports of security vulnerabilities (P14). </li></ul>","footnotes":"<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref1\" id=\"ftnt1\">[1]</a> MTN&rsquo;s transparency report was published in November 2020.
