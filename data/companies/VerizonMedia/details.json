Verizon Media has consistently ranked among the top companies in the RDR Index for strong commitments to and governance over human rights, but falls notably short on some security policies. In July 2020, a California court <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/court-approves-class-action-settlement-re-yahoo-inc-customer-data-security-breach&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1613651741910000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0PQI6qNUpL9o8bH7F6DbgR\">approved a class action settlement</a> in a long-standing case stemming from multiple data breaches over a period of several years that affected billions of Yahoo accounts. The court found that Yahoo had failed to promptly disclose these breaches and ordered the company to beef up its data protection systems and mechanisms for addressing security vulnerabilities. Verizon Media had yet to publish a policy describing how the company handles data breaches as of the publication of the 2020 RDR Index.</p>","changesTitle":"Changes since 2019","changes":"<ul>\n  <li>Verizon Media clarified that it conducts human rights risk assessments on the development and use of algorithms.</li>\n  <li>Verizon Media improved its security policies by committing not to pursue lawsuits or initiate law enforcement investigations against researchers who report security vulnerabilities.</li>\n</ul>","keyRecommendationTitle":"Key recommendations","keyRecommendation":"<ul>\n  <li>Adopt a human rights framework for developing and using algorithms. Verizon Media should publicly commit to using human rights as the primary framework guiding its development and use of algorithms.</li>\n  <li>Be more transparent about rules enforcement. Verizon Media should publish data on content and accounts restricted due to policy violations and disclose more comprehensive data on the enforcement of its ad policies.</li>\n  <li>Improve security policies.<span class=\"font-bold\"> </span>Verizon Media should publish a policy addressing how it handles data breaches, specify how it controls unauthorized employee access to data, and provide information on third-party security audits.</li>\n</ul>","governance":"<p>Verizon Media earned the second-highest governance score among digital platforms we evaluated on the strength of its oversight of human rights issues, robust internal implementation, and some aspects of its human rights due diligence.</p><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Commitment to human rights: </span>Verizon Media made an explicit commitment to protect and respect privacy and freedom of expression as human rights, but did not publish a similar commitment to adhere to human rights principles as it develops and deploys algorithms (G1). </li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Human rights due diligence: </span>Verizon Media provided evidence of robust human rights due diligence, including comprehensive human rights impact assessments (HRIAs) of government regulations in different jurisdictions in which it operates (G4a). The company also revealed that its HRIA process encompasses evaluations of how it enforces its terms of service (G4b) and on its development and deployment of algorithms. Still, we found no equivalent information on targeted advertising (G4c), and it is unclear whether the company&#x2019;s assessments of the impact of its algorithmic systems specifically consider freedom of expression and information, privacy, and non-discrimination.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Stakeholder engagement:</span> Verizon Media is a member of the Global Network Initiative, a multi-stakeholder organization. However, GNI focuses primarily on government demands and does not cover a wider set of human rights issues that internet users face (G5).</li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Remedy: </span>Access to remedy was a weak point in Verizon Media&#x2019;s overall governance score (G6a). The company provided some information on grievance mechanisms, but the scope of these mechanisms was unclear.</li>\n</ul>","freedom":"<p>Verizon Media had clearer terms of service enforcement processes and advertising policies than many of its peers, but it failed to publish sufficient enforcement data.</p><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Content moderation: </span>Yahoo Mail&#x2019;s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines were easy to find and understand<span class=\"font-bold\"> </span>(F1a), but did not clearly explain how users are notified of changes to these policies (F2a).

It was the only company to state that human reviewers examined at least some of its targeting audiences (F3c). Verizon Media&#x2019;s Ad Policy Enforcement Updates provided some data on ads enforcement (F4c). </li>\n</ul>","privacy":"<p>Verizon Media earned the second-best score on privacy after Apple, but fell short on several security indicators. </p><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Handling of user data: </span>Yahoo Mail&#x2019;s<span class=\"font-bold\"> </span>Privacy Policy was clear and easy to find, but did not clearly commit to notifying users of changes prior to those changes coming into effect (P2a). Yahoo Mail did not publish a policy explaining how it develops and trains its algorithms (P1b). The company revealed some information about its data inference practices (P3b). But its Privacy Dashboard and Controls required users to log in to understand what types of data collection and processing they could control (P7).

Verizon Media published an explicit commitment not to pursue legal action against researchers reporting security vulnerabilities (P14). It also retained strong policies on two-factor authentication and other account security features (P17). But Verizon Media failed to specify how it limits and monitors unauthorized employee access to user information and how it conducts third-party audits (P13). The company did not publish a policy on how it addresses data breaches (P15).</li>\n</ul>"}
