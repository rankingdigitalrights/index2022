It did not commit to respecting human rights in its use and development of algorithmic systems (G1). </li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Human rights due diligence: </span>Ooredoo did not publish any evidence that it conducted due diligence to assess human rights impacts or risks associated with its operations, products, or services (G4).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Stakeholder engagement: </span>Ooredoo continued to disclose no systematic engagement with stakeholders that represent, advocate on behalf of, or are people whose privacy and freedom of expression and information are directly impacted by the company (G5).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Remedy: </span>Ooredoo did not provide users with grievance or remedy mechanisms to address their privacy and freedom of expression and information complaints (G6a). The mechanism offered in its Customer Charter is only named &ldquo;unethical sales or customer service behavior,&rdquo; offering no evidence that users can file grievances based on potential violations of their rights.</li></ul>","freedom":"<p>Ooredoo was not transparent about its policies affecting users&rsquo; freedom of expression and information, revealing only scant information about its enforcement processes and policies on network shutdowns. </p><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Content moderation: </span>While Ooredoo&rsquo;s terms and conditions outlined the types of content and activities it does not permit on its services and why it may restrict users&rsquo; accounts, the company was silent on how it enforces these and other rules (F3a). It did not disclose any data about content and account restrictions to enforce its terms of service (F4a, F4b) and did not commit to notifying users of such restrictions (F8).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Advertising content and targeting: </span>Despite providing a SMS service that enabled businesses to target users with ads, Ooredoo did not provide policies outlining its ad content and ad targeting practices (F1b, F1c, F3b, F3c). It did not publish data on ads removed to enforce these rules (F4c).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Network management: </span>Ooredoo did not commit to respecting network neutrality (F9). While it provided vague reasons for why it may shut down service to a particular area or group of users&mdash;for instance, &ldquo;if any competent authority prohibits the provision of the Service in Qatar&rdquo;&mdash;it did not disclose any other policy information elucidating how it would respond to a government shutdown demand (F10). It did not explain why it may restrict access to specific apps and protocols, including VoIP apps (which are outlawed in Qatar), nor did it commit to push back against these types of demands.</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Censorship demands:</span> Ooredoo did not disclose a policy for handling third-party demands to remove content and accounts, including government demands (F5-F7). Article 21 of <a href=\"https://cra.gov.qa/en/document/cybercrime-prevention-law-no-14-of-2014\">Qatar&rsquo;s Cybercrime Prevention Law</a> imposes a variety of obligations on operators, including requiring them to block access to content at the request of judicial authorities. However, there are no regulations in Qatar that prohibit companies from disclosing their process for handling government or private demands to restrict access to content or accounts or publishing data about these demands. </li></ul>","privacy":"<p>Ooredoo revealed the least out of the 12 ranked telecommunications companies about its policies affecting users&rsquo; privacy, though it showed the first signs of progress by publishing a privacy policy. </p><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Handling of user data: </span>For the first time since we added it to the RDR Index in 2017, Ooredoo published a privacy policy. While the policy was easy to find and understandable, it was not available in Arabic, one of the primary languages spoken in Qatar in addition to English (P1a). In the policy, Ooredoo clearly outlined which user information it collects (P3a) and for what purposes (P5). Apart from stating that it may share user information with legal authorities, the company revealed nothing about its data sharing policies, including which user information it shares, with whom, and for what purposes (P4, P5). It was also silent about its data inference policies (P3b), how long it retains user information (P6), and options for users to control and access their information (P7, P8). </li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Government and private demands for user data: </span>Ooredoo did not disclose a policy for handling third-party demands for user information, including government demands (P10-P12). There are no regulations in Qatar that prohibit companies from disclosing their process for handling such demands. </li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Security:</span> Apart from a vague commitment to notify authorities of data breaches that &ldquo;may cause serious damage&rdquo; (P15), Ooredoo did not publish any security policies. For example, it did not publicly describe any internal processes to keep user information secure, such as systems to limit and monitor employee access to user information or an audit mechanism overseen by an internal security team (P13). It also did not provide a bug bounty program, a practice through which many companies enable technical researchers to submit reports of security vulnerabilities (P14).</li></ul>"}
