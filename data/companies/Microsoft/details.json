Microsoft should publish more information about users&#x2019; options to access and control how their data is collected and used.</li>\n</ul>","governance":"<p>Microsoft earned the top spot among digital platforms we evaluated in the governance category, for its strong human rights commitments, oversight, training, and whistleblower programs. But it performed worse on human rights due diligence and access to remedy.</p><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Commitment to human rights: </span>Microsoft made explicit human rights commitments to respect and protect freedom of expression and privacy. But it fell short of articulating clear human rights-based principles for algorithms, instead adopting an ethics-based set of AI principles. It also articulated its commitment to human rights through strong management oversight (G2) and training and whistleblower programs (G3).</li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Human rights due diligence: </span>Microsoft had a strong human rights due diligence process for government regulations in the jurisdictions where it operates (G4a). But it was unclear whether it conducted such assessments on its policy enforcement (G4b) and targeted advertising practices (G4c). Although Microsoft&#x2019;s Human Rights Report described a multi-year HRIA on artificial intelligence, it did not specify the rights covered by this assessment or whether it encompassed both the development and use of algorithmic systems (G4d).</li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Stakeholder engagement: </span>Microsoft is a member of the the Global Network Initiative, a multi-stakeholder organization. However, GNI focuses primarily on government demands and does not include a wider set of human rights issues that internet users face (G5).</li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Remedy: </span>Microsoft&#x2019;s transparency on its grievance and remedy mechanisms was lacking, particularly on access to remedy for freedom of expression and information grievances (G6a). Yet the company&#x2019;s Human Rights Report did include information on privacy-related inquiries submitted through its Privacy Dashboard. Microsoft also provided a form<span class=\"font-bold\"> </span>for users wishing to appeal content and account takedowns on Skype<span class=\"font-bold\">,</span> but the form offered little information about how the appeals process actually works (G6b).</li>\n</ul>","freedom":"<p>Microsoft had the third-best score in this category, behind Twitter and Google. While its terms of service and advertising policies were easy to find and understand, Microsoft revealed little proof of actually enforcing these policies. It also lacked consistent reporting on government and other types of third-party censorship demands.</p><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Content moderation: </span>Microsoft&#x2019;s Services Agreement was easy for users to locate (F1a), though changes to this policy were not communicated clearly enough (F2a). Although Microsoft published policies addressing what content or activities are prohibited, it revealed only fragmented information about how human reviewers and automated systems identify rules violations (F3a). The company did not report explicit data about content removed or accounts suspended for policy violations (F4a, F4b).</li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Algorithmic use and content curation: </span>Microsoft described how it uses artificial intelligence on Bing, but no similar policies were available for other services we evaluated (F1d). It also published information about the variables that influence the algorithmic curation and ranking of search results on Bing, but did not clearly state how users can control these variables (F12).</li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Advertising content and targeting: </span>Microsoft publishes a set of advertising policies that provide information on both content and targeting, but they were not easily accessible from the company&#x2019;s home page (F1b, F1c). While it published some information on its process for enforcing these rules, it did not clearly describe how the company identifies violations (F3b, F3c). Still, Microsoft was one of only four companies in the RDR Index to provide some data about enforcement of its ad policies, though this data was only a year-in-review snapshot and available only for Bing (F4c).</li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Censorship demands:</span> Microsoft reported less comprehensive information about how it handles government censorship demands than any of its U.S. peers except Amazon and Facebook.<span class=\"font-bold\"> </span>Its Content Removal Requests Report offered adequate information on its process for responding to government demands and some information on how it handles private requests, but it did not cover Skype (F5a, F5b). Its data on these demands aggregated both the subjects they were based on and the authorities that submitted them and did not always break them down by country (F6, F7).</li>\n</ul>","privacy":"<p>Microsoft placed third in the privacy category, behind Apple and Verizon Media, and it was the second-best performing company on our security indicators. But its policies on safeguarding user information, data breaches, and private requests for user information were lacking.</p><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Handling of user data: </span>Microsoft&#x2019;s Privacy Statement was easy to find and understand, but the company did not provide a Spanish-language version for its U.S. market (P1a) and did not explain how it notifies users about changes (P2a). Microsoft did not publish a policy explaining how it develops and trains its algorithms (P1b). Microsoft&#x2019;s policies on handling user information were also uneven. It did not provide users with clear options to control (P7) and access the information that the company holds on them (P8). </li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Government and private demands for user data: </span>Microsoft described its process for responding to government demands for user information in its Law Enforcement Requests Report and the report&#x2019;s FAQ page (P10a). It also released a National Security Orders Report. Like other U.S. companies, it did not divulge the exact number of requests received for user data under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or National Security Letters, or the actions it took in response to these requests, since it is prohibited by <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2048&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1613642726241000&amp;usg=AOvVaw30PSX0S3QJYIvVCiLvh0wF\">law</a> from doing so (P11a).

The company improved its security oversight policies (P13) and clarified that it would not pursue legal action against individuals who report security vulnerabilities (P14). Although Microsoft provided some information about its process for responding to data breaches affecting Outlook and OneDrive, it offered none for Bing and Skype (P15).</li>\n</ul>"}
