The <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/malaysia/freedom-net/2019\">Malaysian government</a> prosecutes users for online speech that is deemed insulting to Islam or the monarchy, and legal protections for digital privacy in the country are poor. Although there are no laws preventing Axiata&rsquo;s Malaysian operating company, Celcom, from expanding its transparency in this area, the company disclosed nothing in 2020 about how it responds to government or private requests to block content or carry out network shutdowns.</p>","changesTitle":"Changes since 2019","changes":"<ul><li>Axiata published materials that provided its users with guidance on how to protect themselves from cybersecurity risks. </li><li>Axiata published a commitment to privacy and clarified management-level oversight over that commitment. </li><li>Axiata improved its disclosure of its process for responding to government demands for user information, including a limited commitment to perform due diligence on those types of demands.</li></ul>","keyRecommendationTitle":"Key recommendations","keyRecommendation":"<ul><li>Increase transparency and push back on network shutdown orders.

It made no commitment to freedom of expression (G1).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Human rights due diligence: </span>Though it offered a vague suggestion that it conducts privacy impact assessments on some of its activities, Axiata disclosed no comprehensive process to identify the human rights risks of its actions, such as discrimination in targeted advertising or freedom of expression and information harms resulting from company policy enforcement (G4).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Stakeholder engagement:</span> Axiata disclosed no evidence of systematically engaging with stakeholders that represent, advocate on behalf of, or are people whose privacy and freedom of expression and information are directly impacted by the company (G5). </li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Remedy: </span>Axiata offered a mechanism for users to file complaints related to privacy. However, it was not clear that users could file a complaint if they believed the company harmed or threatened their freedom of expression. Axiata did not explain its process for providing remedy for the grievances it receives (G6a).</li></ul>","freedom":"<p>Axiata disclosed little about policies affecting freedom of expression, though it slightly outperformed Am&eacute;rica M&oacute;vil, Ooredoo, and Bharti Airtel in this category. </p><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Content blocking and account restrictions:</span> Though Axiata improved the readability of its Fair Usage Policy, some terms of service documents were still available only in English and not offered in Malay (F1).

It also failed to provide data showing how many requests it received and how many it complied with (F6, F7). The <a href=\"http://www.commonlii.org/my/legis/consol_act/osa1972156/\">Official Secrets Act of 1972</a> may prohibit reporting the content of government requests, but it should not bar Axiata from disclosing its process for addressing them.</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Network management:</span> The company made no commitment to net neutrality (F9) and offered a zero-rating program with cost-free access to selected news sources and services. It did not reveal a process for handling government demands to shut down its network (F10), even though it carried out <a href=\"https://netblocks.org/reports/sri-lanka-blocks-social-media-for-third-time-in-one-month-M8JRjg80\">network shutdowns</a> in Sri Lanka, at the behest of government officials, in 2019.</li></ul>","privacy":"<p>Axiata made modest improvements to its overall privacy score.</p><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Handling of user data: </span>The company revealed some of the types of information it collects (P3a), infers (P3b), and shares (P4), and it provided some information about why it does this (P5).

Although Axiata released new materials to educate users about cybersecurity risks (P18), its security policies remained scant. Axiata was silent on how it handles data breaches (P15) and security vulnerabilities (P14).</li></ul>"}
