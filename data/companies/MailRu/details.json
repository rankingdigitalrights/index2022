Nevertheless, Russia&rsquo;s restrictive regulatory environment makes it difficult for companies like Mail.Ru to respect these rights in practice. Authorities increasingly <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/18/russia-growing-internet-isolation-control-censorship\">pressure platforms</a> to cooperate in censorship and surveillance demands.

Mail.Ru disclosed nothing about how it responds to government censorship demands and provided no data on such requests, although Russian law does not prevent it from doing so.

It ranked ninth among the 14 digital platform companies, and scored lower in this category than its Russian peer, Yandex.</p><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Content moderation: </span>Mail.Ru disclosed which activities and types of content it does not permit on its services, but it was not clear about the processes it uses to identify content or accounts that violate its rules, including the role of algorithmic systems in those processes (F3a). It did not publish any data about content and account restrictions due to terms-of-service violations (F4a, F4b). It also failed to commit to notifying users of content restrictions (F8).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Algorithmic use and</span><span className=\"font-bold\"> c</span><span className=\"font-bold\">ontent curation: </span>Mail.Ru did not disclose a policy describing how it uses algorithmic systems (F1d). It provided examples of how the algorithms are used to show users &quot;personalized&quot; content but did not describe how it uses algorithmic systems to curate, rank, or recommend content on VK, its social networking platform (F12). </li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Advertising content and targeting: </span>Mail.Ru revealed what types of ad content it does not permit, but failed to explain how it enforces its ad content rules (F3b). It also lacked transparency about its ad targeting rules and enforcement processes, offering no detail on what types of targeting parameters it prohibits (F3c). The company also failed to publish any data around the enforcement of its ad content and targeting rules (F4c). </li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Censorship demands:</span> Mail.Ru lacked transparency about its handling of third-party demands to remove content and accounts. Authorities require VK to censor various types of content, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/10/08/russia-censors-lgbt-online-groups\">including LGBTQ material,</a> content deemed insulting to &ldquo;<a href=\"http://rapsinews.com/news/20190711/301582626.html\">state symbols</a>,&rdquo; and most recently, <a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/03/20/russian-news-outlets-ordered-to-take-down-fake-coronavirus-news-a69699\">disinformation</a> related to COVID-19. The company disclosed nothing about its process to address these demands, including whether it pushes back on overly broad censorship requests (F5a). The company was more transparent when it came to private requests to remove content, disclosing a process for handling copyright and terms of service-related private content removal requests on VK (F5b).</li></ul>","privacy":"<p>Despite several improvements in this category, Mail.Ru disclosed insufficient information about its policies affecting users&rsquo; privacy. It tied with Yandex for 10th place among digital platforms. </p><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Handling of user data: </span>Mail.Ru lacked transparency about its handling of user information. In the privacy policy for VK, the company acknowledged one type of information it infers (interests of users) based on user data but offered no further details on inference, and it did not offer users the ability to control what data the company infers about them (P3b, P7). Mail.Ru failed to provide any rules on how its algorithmic systems are developed (P1b) or whether users can control how the company uses their information to develop these systems (P7). </li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Government and private demands for user data: </span>Mail.Ru disclosed its process for responding to government demands for user information, including a commitment to push back against &ldquo;unfounded&rsquo;&rsquo; demands (P10a). However, the company disclosed no data about these types of demands (P11). </li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Security: </span>Like many of its peers, Mail.Ru provided resources and tools to help users protect their account security (P17, P18), but offered limited information about its own data security measures and protocols. It disclosed that it has a security team that conducts audits and that it limits unauthorized employee access to user information, although it was unclear if such access is monitored (P13). It did not articulate a process for responding to data breaches (P15). While it has a bug bounty program allowing external researchers to submit reports of security vulnerabilities, it fell short of pledging not to pursue legal action against them (P14).</li></ul><ul><li><span className=\"font-bold\">Encryption:</span> Mail.Ru disclosed that it encrypts user communications on Mail.Ru email and VK but was silent regarding Mail.Ru Cloud and explicitly stated that messages on Mail.Ru Agent are totally unencrypted (P16). Russian law <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/18/russia-growing-internet-isolation-control-censorship\">requires</a> Mail.ru, Yandex, and many other technology companies to provide encryption keys to law enforcement on an ongoing basis.</li></ul>"}
