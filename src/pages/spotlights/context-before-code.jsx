      from the circumstances created by the pandemic, all the companies were
      caught off guard by the impact of COVID-19 on their own users. Yet they
      have all weathered crises before. Telcos have raced to repair

      with government censorship orders in the face of political upheaval.

      When social media posts inciting political violence go viral, the

      different contexts. Strong due diligence can help predict, for instance,
      the rise of fringe movements in social media communities or the likelihood
      of coordinated extremist violence moving from online spaces into real
      life. Yet only four companies we ranked appeared to conduct impact
      assessments of their own policy enforcement, where these kinds of threats
      often arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Companies cannot build resilience to shocks without bridging these gaps,
      and it is virtually certain that more governments will soon make
      conducting due diligence compulsory for companies. We urge companies to
      conduct these assessments before they launch new products or services, or
      enter new markets, to mitigate harms before they happen.

    <h2>How can companies prepare for crisis?</h2>
    <p>
      No person or company can anticipate every harm that will arise in an
      emergency. But there is a significant distance between this zone of
      impossibility and the lack of preparedness that many companies exhibited
      in 2020. Our indicators, which draw extensively from international human
      rights doctrine and the expertise of human rights advocates around the
      world, offer a path forward.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether circumstances are ordinary or extraordinary, companies should
      pursue three objectives (among many others) if they seek to improve.
    </p>
    <h3>1. Publicly commit to human rights</h3>
    <p>
      Companies must make a public commitment to respect human rights standards
      across their operations.
      <sup>
        <a id="ftnt_ref3" href="#ftnt3">
          [3]
        </a>
      </sup>{" "}
      Of course, a policy alone will not improve performance. As our 2020 data
      showed, many companies in the RDR Index committed to human rights in
      principle, but failed to demonstrate these commitments through the
      practices that actually affect users&rsquo; rights. These kinds of
      commitments can serve as a tool for a company to measure and document
      violations, and for advocates to push for better policies at the product
      and service level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take Apple, which was one of the most improved companies in the 2020
      Index, largely due to a new{" "}
      <NarrativeLink href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_downloads/gov_docs/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf">
        human rights policy
      </NarrativeLink>{" "}
      that the company published after years of{" "}
      <NarrativeLink href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/2020/10/09/the-radar-weve-got-our-eyes-on-apple/">
        sustained pressure by RDR
      </NarrativeLink>{" "}
      and others. When Apple delayed the rollout of pro-privacy, anti-tracking
      features in iOS 14, advocates (including RDR) were able to{" "}
      <NarrativeLink href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/19/apple-privacy-letter-ios-14-facebook/">
        use the new policy
      </NarrativeLink>{" "}
      to hold the company to account.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Double down on due diligence</h3>
    <p>
      <span className="pull-quote">
        Large multinational companies like the ones in our index can no longer
        plead ignorance.
      </span>{" "}
      They must reinforce their policy commitments by putting human rights at
      the center of their practices, and carrying out robust human rights due
      diligence.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Companies that conduct human rights impact assessments should see early
      warning signs when political or social conflict is on the horizon, and
      they can act on this by enhancing scrutiny of online activity, stanching
      the spread of inciting or hateful content, or even notifying authorities,
      where appropriate. When chaos erupts, a company with strong due diligence
      processes in place can quickly identify how its platform may be used to
      cause harm and activate protocols to protect potential victims.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Pull back the curtain and report data</h3>
    <p>
      Companies can and do report some data on their enforcement of their own
      policies, along with compliance with government censorship and
      surveillance demands, in the form of transparency reports.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      While 16 companies in the RDR Index offer some kind of transparency report
      (and two others have begun doing so since our research cutoff date), none
      of these companies does nearly enough to show users, civil society, or
      policymakers what&rsquo;s really happening behind the curtain.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <FigureImg
      img={ImgChartF4}
      alt="TODO - What information do companies&rsquo; transparency reports include?"
    />
    <p>
      Only five companies in the 2020 RDR Index published data about enforcement
      of their own policies and only six revealed data on government censorship
      demands. Even existing transparency reports suffer from major blind spots.
      Facebook&rsquo;s{" "}
      <NarrativeLink href="https://transparency.facebook.com/community-standards-enforcement">
        Community Standards Enforcement Report
      </NarrativeLink>
      , for example, does not include the total volume of restricted content or
      accounts, enforcement by restriction type, or country-specific
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, such gaps can deprive users and researchers of the ability to
      map enforcement surges to specific events, especially as companies expand
      their arsenal of enforcement actions. Greater clarity here would brighten
      what remains a grim landscape.

    <h2>Better late than never</h2>

      Without preparedness, crises spin out of control. Understaffed hospitals

      core institutions overwhelmed by frenzied mobs, and social media companies
      fail to quash online threats of violence before they lead to real-life
      harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Companies can address these harms by anchoring all of their actions in
      international human rights standards. Companies that build respect for
      human rights into their policies and products from the start will always
      be better prepared to face uncertainty than those that do not.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we continue to grapple with a global crisis that has kindled
      innumerable local fires, companies continue to make ad hoc decisions that
      affect millions. They are late to embrace these standards. But late is
      better than never.

                    Appeals on Instagram were turned off completely, according
                    to the same report. The figures are based on
                    Facebook&rsquo;s disclosed categories of enforcement data.
                    Facebook did not explicitly state whether the sum of these
                    categories represents all of the enforcement actions it
                    takes on its platform.

                    When COVID - 19 hit, both Facebook and Google (YouTube’ s
                    parent company) sent their content moderators home, and
                    deployed algorithms more extensively to review content.
                  </p>
                  <p>Facebook almost completely shut off its appeals option.</p>
                  <p>
                    YouTube kept it enabled, and put extra resources into
                    reviewing appeals and restoring content.
