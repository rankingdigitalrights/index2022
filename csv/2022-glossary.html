        <p>An algorithm is a set of instructions used to process information and deliver an output based on the instructions’ stipulations. Algorithms can be simple pieces of code but they can also be incredibly complex, “encoding for thousands of variables across millions of data points.” In the context of internet, mobile, and telecommunications companies, some algorithms—because of their complexity, the amounts and types of user information fed into them, and the decision-making function they serve—have significant implications for users’ human rights, including freedom of expression and privacy.

      <div class='entry-text'>
        <div class='entry-tag'>Anonymous data</div>
        <p>Data that is in no way connected to another piece of information that could enable a user to be identified. The expansive nature of this definition used by the Ranking Digital Rights project is necessary to reflect several facts. First, skilled analysts can de-anonymize large data sets. This renders nearly all promises of anonymization unattainable. In essence, any data tied to an “anonymous identifier” is not anonymous; rather, this is often pseudonymous data which may be tied back to the user’s offline identity. Second, metadata may be as or more revealing of a user’s associations and interests than content data, thus this data is of vital interest. Third, entities that have access to many sources of data, such as data brokers and governments, may be able to pair two or more data sources to reveal information about users. Thus, sophisticated actors can use data that seems anonymous to construct a larger picture of a user.

        <p>Content moderation is the practice of screening user-generated content posted to internet sites, social media, and other online outlets, in order to determine the appropriateness of the content for a given site, locality, or jurisdiction. The process can result in the content being removed or restricted by a moderator, acting as an agent of the platform or site in question. Increasingly, companies in addition to human moderators rely on algorithmic systems to moderate content and information on their platforms.

        <p>Companies are able to draw inferences and predictions about the behaviors, preferences, and private lives of its users by applying “big data” analytics and algorithmic decision making technologies. These methods might be used to make inferences about user preferences or attributes (e.g., race, gender, sexual orientation), and opinions (e.g., political stances), or to predict behaviors (e.g., to serve advertisements). Without sufficient transparency and user control over data inference, privacy-invasive and non-verifiable inferences cannot be predicted, understood, or refuted by users.

        <div class='entry-tag'>Do Not Track</div>
        <p>Also known by the acronym “DNT,” this refers to a setting in a user’s browser preferences that tells companies or third parties not to “track” them. In other words, every time a user loads a website, any parties that are involved in delivering the page (of which there are often many, primarily advertisers) are told not to collect or store any information about the user’s visit to the page. However, this is merely a polite request; a company may ignore a DNT request, and many do.

      <div class='entry-text'>
        <div class='entry-tag'>Encryption</div>
        <p>This essentially hides the content of communications or files so only the intended recipient can view it. The process uses an algorithm to convert the message (plaintext) into a coded format (ciphertext) so that the message looks like a random series of characters to anyone who looks at it. Only someone who has the appropriate encryption key can decrypt the message, reversing the ciphertext back into plaintext. Data can be encrypted when it is stored and when it is in transmission.</p>
        <p>For example, users can encrypt the data on their hard drive so that only the user with the encryption key can decipher the contents of the drive. Additionally, users can send an encrypted email message, which would prevent anyone from seeing the email contents while the message is moving through the network to reach the intended recipient. With encryption in transit (for example, when a website uses HTTPS), the communication between a user and a website is encrypted, so that outsiders, such as the user’s internet service provider, can only see the initial visit to the website, but not what the user communicates on that website, or the sub-pages that the user visits.

        <p>Ideally, companies publish information about the requests they receive so that the public has a better understanding of how content gets restricted on the platform. Companies may provide information about the requests they receive to a third-party archive, such as <a href='https://cyber.harvard.edu/research/lumen'>Lumen </a>(formerly called Chilling Effects), which is an independent research project that manages a publicly available database of requests for removal of online content. This type of repository helps researchers and the public understand the types of content that are requested for removal, as well as gain a better understanding of legitimate and illegitimate requests.

        <div class='entry-tag'>Real-time communications access</div>
        <p>Surveillance of a conversation or other electronic communication in “real time” while the conversation is taking place, or interception of data at the very moment it is being transmitted. This is also sometimes called a “wiretap.” Consider the difference between a request for a wiretap and a request for stored data. A wiretap gives law enforcement authority to access future communications, while a request for stored data gives law enforcement access to records of communications that occurred in the past. The U.S. government can gain real-time communications access through the Wiretap Act and Pen Register Act, both part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA); the Russian government can do so through the “System for Operative Investigative Activities” (SORM).

        <div class='entry-tag'>Retention of user information</div>
        <p>A company may collect data and then delete it. If the company does not delete it, the data is “retained.” The time between collection and deletion is the “retention period”. Such data may fall under our definition of “user information,” or it may be anonymous. Keep in mind that truly anonymous data may in no way be connected to a user, the user’s identity, behavior, or preference, which is very rare.</p>
        <p>A related topic is the “retention period.” For example, a company may collect log data on a continual basis, but purge (delete) the data once a week. In this case, the data retention period is one week. However, if no retention period is specified, the default assumption must be that the data is never deleted, and the retention period is therefore indefinite. In many cases users may wish for their data to be retained while they are actively using the service, but would like it to be deleted (and therefore not retained) if and when they quit using the service. For example, users may want a social network service to keep all of their private messages, but when the user leaves the network they may wish that all of their private messages be deleted.

        <p>Many companies allow users to “opt out” of tracking by setting an array of company-specific cookies. If a user deletes cookies in order to protect privacy, they are then tracked until they reset the “opt-out” cookie. Furthermore, some companies may require a user to install a browser add-on to prevent tracking. These two common scenarios are examples of users being forced to use signals which are company-specific, and therefore do not count. Rather, a user-generated signal comes from the user and is a universal message that the user should not be tracked. The primary option for user-generated signals today is the “Do Not Track” header (covered above), but this wording leaves the door open to future means for users to signal they do not want to be tracked.

User information is never considered anonymous except when included solely as a basis to generate global measures (e.g. number of active monthly users). For example, the statement, ‘Our service has 1 million monthly active users,’ contains anonymous data, since it does not give enough information to know who those 1 million users are.
